I am a math PhD candidate at the University of Toronto. I do set theory. I am interested in choiceless models. This year (AY 23/24), I am co-organizing the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/student-set-theory-seminar/home">Student Set Theory and Combinatorics Seminar</a> (SSTCS) with <a href="https://clementyung.github.io/">Clement Yung</a>. I can be contacted via email at venkatb(at)math(dot)utoronto(dot)ca.
