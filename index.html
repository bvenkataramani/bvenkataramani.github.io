  <p>I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto. I am interested in set theory. I find choiceless models the most interesting. More recently, I have been learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_space">Toronto spaces</a>.</p>
  <p>See the braid visualizer <a href="braid_visualizer.html">here</a>. <b>Basic usage:</b> Connect pegs from top down as is convention. Each set of three pegs denotes a single braid. Multi-levelled for visualization of braid concatenation. To delete a strand, simply redrag the line. Crossings are set to "over" by default, so if you want P1->P2 to be above P2->P1, draw P1->P2 first. Enables saving images of canvas state and compression for desired presentation. Probably breakable.</p>
  <p><a href="pinormality.html">Here</a> you can watch the digits of pi attempt to traverse a randomly generated maze. This was motivated by the conjectured normality of pi and the Twitch stream "Pi Plays Pokemon" by WinningSequence. You can see it <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/winningsequence">here</a>. Someday I may consider increasing the sequence limit but for now it is just hard-coded into the application.</p>
  <p>I also built <a href="https://github.com/bvenkataramani/stackclone">stackclone</a>, a StackExchange Teams clone with math mode and custom commands for personal use. If it helps you, please feel free to use it.</p>
