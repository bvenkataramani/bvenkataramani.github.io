  <p>I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto. I am interested in set theory. I find choiceless models the most interesting. More recently, I have been learning about Toronto spaces.</p>
  <p>See the braid visualizer <a href="braid_visualizer.html">here</a>. <b>Basic usage:</b> Connect pegs from top down as is convention. Each set of three pegs denotes a single braid. Multi-levelled for visualization of braid concatenation. To delete a strand, simply redrag the line. Crossings are set to "over" by default, so if you want P1->P2 to be above P2->P1, draw P1->P2 first. Enables saving images of canvas state and compression for desired presentation. Probably breakable.</p>
  <p>I built a pretty basic attention span testing game. You can play it <a href="attention_game.html">here</a>. The idea is essentially to mimic what happens at boring meetings where there are still one or two important pieces of information you need to catch without zoning out completely or messing around on your phone. Largely written for myself. I will eventually add a feature where the number of balls flitting across the screen changes randomly within some randomly timed period. It's just a prototype for something that will probably never be finished.</p>
