I am a math PhD candidate at the University of Toronto. I do set theory. I am interested in choiceless models. This year (AY 23/24), I am co-organizing the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/student-set-theory-seminar/home">Student Set Theory and Combinatorics Seminar</a> (SSTCS) with <a href="https://clementyung.github.io/">Clement Yung</a>. I can be contacted via email at venkatb(at)math(dot)utoronto(dot)ca.

    <b>[May 10th, 2024]</b> On May 6th, Roberto Demontis uploaded a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03731">paper</a> to the Arxiv with a proof of Frankl's Union-Closed Conjecture. I'll upload my thoughts on the paper here in a few days...

      <li><b>[May 11th, 2024]</b>Okay, so from what I've seen so far, I think that the idea of the proof is to describe the process of getting from the power-set to the union-closed family, and showing that this process can be refined without deleting too many sets containing some element. Up to Theorem 3, the argument seems fine. I will keep reading...</li>
