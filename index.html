  See the braid visualizer <a href="braid_visualizer.html">here</a>. <b>Basic usage:</b> Connect pegs from top down as is convention. Each set of three pegs denotes a single braid. Multi-levelled for visualization of braid concatenation. To delete a strand, simply redrag the line. Crossings are set to "over" by default, so if you want P1->P2 to be above P2->P1, draw P1->P2 first. Enables saving images of canvas state and compression for desired presentation. Probably breakable.
